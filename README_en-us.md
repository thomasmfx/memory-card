# Tara's Memory Card

üåê [PT-BR](./README.md)

## Description

Tara's Memory Card is a simple memory game based in the mobile game Brawl Stars. The main goal of the game is to test the player's memory abilities, by selecting different characters without repeating them. Each succesfull play increases the score by one, and each 12 succesfull plays a new deck is generated, the game only ends when the player clicks twice on the same character in a deck, resetting the score.

The project uses assets from [Supercell Fankit](https://fankit.supercell.com/) and loads images and character's info using the BrawlAPI from [Brawlify.com](https://brawlify.com/).
